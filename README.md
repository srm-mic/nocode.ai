## Immediate todos

- [x] Verify forward pass

- [ ] Only last node in forward pass returns. As in multi return forward pass
      note supported.

- [x] Model loading

## Support to be added

- [ ] Unnamed parameters in yaml file

- [ ] Negative indices in concat/add operations

- [ ] Maybe remove node attribute from wrapper after adding to module list

- [ ] Remove the necessity of the first entry in YAML File to be identifier for ops like concat

- [ ] **Memory efficiency: save intermediate steps only when required by a later node**
